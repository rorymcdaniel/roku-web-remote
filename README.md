## Synopsis

A web based remote for controlling your Roku. Because you can never find the remote, and sometimes your phone battery is dead.

## Setup

On first load, an alert window will ask you for the IP address of your Roku. It then sets a cookie and will not ask for the IP
address again for 365 days. You can clear this cookie at any time by clicking the clear cookie link in the bottom right hand corner.
